To complete this test:

1. Fork the github repository https://github.com/pvanheus/python2015_test

2. Clone your forked repository (not the original) using `git clone`

3. `cd` into the resulting `python2015_test` directory and start `ipython notebook` there.

4. Complete the exercises in the notebook, ensuring that the tests in the notebook report that your answers are correct.

5. Save the notebook and commit it to your git repository (with `git add` and `git commit`).

6. Push the final notebook to GitHub (`git push`) and send an email with a subject line like `PY2015TEST https://github.com/exampleuser/python2015_test` to pvh@sanbi.ac.za.
